# Game of Life

# About game
Game "Life" (Conway's Game of Life) - "cellular machine". It was invented by the English mathematician John Horton Conway in the distant 1970s.

The playing surface is an infinite or limited field divided into a certain number of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. With each move the population of the field changes according to simple rules:
1) A cell with less than two neighbors dies of loneliness;
2) A cage with more than three neighbors dies of overpopulation;
3) A dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life.

The game world develops without the help of a player. From it you only need to arrange the cells for the first generation. Often the development of the world becomes completely unpredictable. Cells form complex patterns, and as soon as you begin to think that you have understood everything, they suddenly die out, or "hang" in an endless cycle.

# About program
In this program you have two parameters :
1) Resolution - this parameter control how close you will see cells.
2) Density - this parameter control how many cells you will see.

You also have three buttons :
1) Start - to start a new genration.
2) Stop - to stop moving current generation (you can't press this button if you won't press "Start").
3) Continue - if you pressed "Stop"? you can press "Continue" to continue the life of cells.
